        <ul>
            <li>
                Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elementc

                <span class="container2">in tutorial we will use inline and internal style</span>, because this is
                easier
                to demonstrastrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.

        When compairing CSS class vs ID, the different in that CSS class applied a style to multiple element.
        ID, on the other hand, applied applied a style to one unique element.ID is also
        special in that you can use a special URL to link directaly to an element and it's
        used by JS.
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element 
        or range of elements on a web page. Once a element has been
        targeted, a style or a set of style can be applied to the element.

    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most common used 
        are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
